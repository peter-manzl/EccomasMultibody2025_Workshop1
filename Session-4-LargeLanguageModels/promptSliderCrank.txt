Using the previous information and the already existing information on Python code Exudyn, create a 3-link system of rigid bodies initially aligned along the X-axis with mass 10kg, length 2m and W=H=0.1 m. The rigid bodies are exposed to gravity which acts in Y-direction and the first link is attached to ground with a revolute joint at the left end. Add a prismatic joint to the last link.
